# Sensors and Actuators

Sensors and actuators are fundamental components of humanoid robots. This chapter explores the different types of sensors and actuators used in robotics.

## Sensors

Sensors allow robots to perceive their environment. Common sensor types include:

### Vision Sensors

Vision sensors, such as cameras and depth sensors, enable robots to see and interpret their surroundings. These are crucial for:
- Object recognition
- Navigation
- Obstacle avoidance
- Facial recognition

### Tactile Sensors

Tactile sensors provide information about physical contact. They help robots:
- Detect collisions
- Measure grip force
- Sense texture
- Provide feedback for delicate manipulation

### Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)

IMUs combine accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure:
- Linear acceleration
- Angular velocity
- Orientation in space

These are essential for balance and stability control.

## Actuators

Actuators convert energy into motion. The main types include:

### Servo Motors

Servo motors provide precise position control and are commonly used in robot joints. They offer:
- Accurate positioning
- Good torque control
- Feedback mechanisms

### Hydraulic Actuators

Hydraulic systems use pressurized fluid for powerful actuation. Benefits include:
- High force output
- Smooth motion
- Compact design

## Integration

Effective integration of sensors and actuators is key to creating responsive and capable humanoid robots.
