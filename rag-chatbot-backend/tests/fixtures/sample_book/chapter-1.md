# Introduction to Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robotics is an exciting field that combines engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence. This chapter provides an overview of humanoid robots and their applications.

## What is a Humanoid Robot?

A humanoid robot is a robot with a body shape built to resemble the human body. The design may be for functional purposes, such as interacting with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, or for other reasons.

Humanoid robots typically have:
- A torso
- A head with sensors
- Two arms and hands
- Two legs for bipedal locomotion

## History of Humanoid Robotics

The concept of humanoid robots has existed in science fiction for decades. However, practical humanoid robots only began to emerge in the late 20th century. Notable early examples include Honda's ASIMO and Sony's QRIO.

## Applications

Humanoid robots are used in various fields including:
- Healthcare and elderly care
- Education and research
- Entertainment
- Space exploration
- Disaster response

These versatile machines continue to evolve as technology advances.
