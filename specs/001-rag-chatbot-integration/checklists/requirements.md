# Specification Quality Checklist: RAG Chatbot Integration for Digital Book

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items passed successfully. The specification is complete, testable, and ready for the next phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Comprehensive user stories with clear priorities (P1, P2, P3)
- Well-defined edge cases covering error scenarios and boundary conditions
- 20 functional requirements that are specific and testable
- 12 success criteria that are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Clear scope boundaries distinguishing in-scope from out-of-scope features
- Detailed assumptions and constraints documented
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are unambiguous

**Ready for**: `/sp.clarify` (if needed) or `/sp.plan`
