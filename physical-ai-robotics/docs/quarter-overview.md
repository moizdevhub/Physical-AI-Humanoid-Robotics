# Quarter Overview

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course.

## Course Structure

This quarter-long course is organized into four modules and a capstone project:

1. **Module 1: Robotic Nervous System** - Understanding ROS 2 communication and control
2. **Module 2: Digital Twin** - Simulation environments and virtual testing
3. **Module 3: AI-Robot Brain** - Integrating AI models with robotic control
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action** - VLA models for embodied intelligence
5. **Capstone Project** - Integration of all concepts into a complete humanoid robot application

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will:

- Build and deploy ROS 2 applications for robot control
- Create digital twins in Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Integrate AI models with robotic systems
