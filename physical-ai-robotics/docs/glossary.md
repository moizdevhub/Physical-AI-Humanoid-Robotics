# Glossary

## A

**Action** - In ROS 2, a communication pattern for long-running tasks that provides feedback and can be preempted.

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)** - The simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling learning, reasoning, and decision-making.

## D

**Digital Twin** - A virtual replica of a physical robot used for simulation, testing, and development.

**DDS (Data Distribution Service)** - The middleware layer used by ROS 2 for real-time communication.

## E

**Embodied Intelligence** - AI that is physically grounded in a robot body, enabling interaction with the real world.

## G

**Gazebo** - An open-source 3D robotics simulator for testing robots in realistic environments.

## H

**Humanoid Robot** - A robot with a body shape built to resemble the human body, typically with torso, head, arms, and legs.

## I

**Isaac Sim** - NVIDIA's robotics simulation platform built on Omniverse, offering GPU-accelerated physics and rendering.

## N

**Node** - In ROS 2, an executable that performs computation and communicates via topics, services, or actions.

## P

**Physical AI** - Artificial intelligence designed to control physical embodiments (robots) in real-world environments.

**Publisher** - A ROS 2 node that sends messages on a topic.

## R

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)** - A flexible framework for writing robot software, providing communication infrastructure and tools.

## S

**Service** - In ROS 2, a synchronous request-response communication pattern.

**Subscriber** - A ROS 2 node that receives messages from a topic.

## T

**Topic** - In ROS 2, a named bus over which nodes exchange messages via publisher-subscriber pattern.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** - XML format for describing robot models in ROS.

## V

**VLA (Vision-Language-Action)** - Models that integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and robotic action execution.
