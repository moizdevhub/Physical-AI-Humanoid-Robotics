# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Bridge the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment. Learn to apply AI knowledge to control humanoid robots through hands-on projects and simulations.

## 🎯 What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll create a complete humanoid robot system that:

- **Responds to natural language commands** using Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
- **Perceives the environment** through simulated camera and sensor systems
- **Plans and executes actions** in real-time using ROS 2
- **Operates in realistic simulations** via Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim

## 📚 Learning Path

This quarter-long curriculum is organized into four progressive modules plus an integration capstone:

### [Module 1: Robotic Nervous System](modules/module-01-robotic-nervous-system/index.md)
Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as the communication backbone for distributed robot control. Learn pub-sub patterns, services, and actions.

### [Module 2: Digital Twin](modules/module-02-digital-twin/index.md)
Create virtual robot replicas using Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim. Develop and test behaviors safely before physical deployment.

### [Module 3: AI-Robot Brain](modules/module-03-ai-robot-brain/index.md)
Integrate AI models with robotic control systems. Implement planning algorithms, reinforcement learning, and behavior trees for autonomous decision-making.

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action](modules/module-04-vision-language-action/index.md)
Build end-to-end VLA pipelines that enable robots to understand visual scenes, process language commands, and execute physical actions.

### [Capstone Project](capstone/index.md)
Synthesize all four modules into a complete humanoid robot application demonstrating embodied intelligence.
